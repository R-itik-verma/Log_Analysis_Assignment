# Log_Analysis_Assignment
Python script for analyzing log files to extract and analyze key information, including request counts per IP address, most frequently accessed endpoint, and detection of suspicious activity. Developed as part of the VRV Security Python Intern assignment.

This repository contains a Python script that processes log files for data analysis.  
The script fulfills the following requirements:

- **Count Requests per IP Address**: Displays request counts for each IP address.
- **Identify the Most Frequently Accessed Endpoint**: Finds the endpoint accessed most often.
- **Detect Suspicious Activity**: Flags IPs with failed login attempts exceeding a configurable threshold.

## Files
- `log_analysis.py`: The main Python script.
- `sample.log`: A sample log file used for testing.
- `log_analysis_results.csv`: The CSV file generated by the script.
